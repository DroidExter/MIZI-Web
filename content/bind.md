BIND is a suite of software tools for working with DNS developed by the Internet Systems Consortium. BIND can be configured as an authoritative nameserver or a recursive resolver. Thanks to its flexibility, it can also fulfill the roles of multiple types of DNS servers simultaneously. These strengths have contributed to BIND becoming the most widely used DNS server software and de facto standard on Unix-like operating systems [^bind_docs] [^bind_wiki].

Its latest version, 9, released in 2000, brought many new features, including support for IPv6. This version is still being updated [^bind_wiki].
