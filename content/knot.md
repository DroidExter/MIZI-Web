Knot DNS is an open-source authoritative DNS server. It was built from the ground up and is actively developed by the Czech organization CZ.NIC, the administrator of the .cz domain. The goal of this project is to provide an alternative open-source implementation of an authoritative DNS server that is suitable for TLD (Top-Level Domain) operators and contributes to enhancing the overall security, stability, and resilience of the DNS system [^knot_dns].

The CZ.NIC organization also offers the open-source software Knot Resolver, which is a modern implementation of a recursive DNS resolver designed for scalability, resilience, and flexibility [^knot_resolver].
